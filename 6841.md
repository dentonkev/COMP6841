## Security Engineering
The principles and practice of designing and managing complex systems against adversaries in a world of humans, technology, cryptography and regulation.
- Cyber security refers to when things go wrong, when things go out of the spec.

## Mindset

**DAEH**

**Defender Mindset**: A protective approach centered on preventing attacks or mitigating damage. Focuses on safeguarding assets, anticipating threats, and maintaining stability.

**Attacker Mindset**: A proactive, offensive approach focused on exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Emphasises initiative and finding ways to overcome defenses.

**Engineering Mindset**: A problem-solving approach focused on designing practical solutions while following standards (set of rules followed by all engineers), constraints, testing, modelling and optimising.

- measurement
- skepticism
- testing
- review
- openness/transparency
- treatment of errors
- standards
- professionalism
- closing the loop.

## Security Theatre
Security theater is the practice of implementing security measures that are considered to **provide the feeling of improved security** while doing **little or nothing** to achieve it.

## Physical Security
Physical security focuses on establishing a solid foundation to safeguard systems from threats such as tampering or counterfeiting.
- very hard to get physical security right

## Phases of an attack
Generally an attack start with recon and planning until a vulnerability is found which can then be exploited. 

### Recon
Beginning of an attack, goal is find out more information about what is being attacked. 
- can be **passive** or **active**

## 0 day attacks
0 days refers to a software security flaw that is **unknown** to the software vendor and has not been patched so it can be exploited by attackers.

## Harvard and Von Neumann Architecture
- Harvard architecture has two physically seperate pieces of mememory (slower but safer)

- Von Neumann architecture was chosen for legacy computers
  - same memory stack for both data and control
  - two memory items in one physical piece.


## Buffer Overflow
- The stack grows from **high addresses** to **low addresses**

## Risk and Trust

### Security Patterns
- **Anti-pattern (complexity)**: Overly complex systems increase the likelihood of security vulnerabilities 
- **Dual control**: Multiple entities need to work together (all keys turned at same time)
- **Defence in depth**: A multi-layered approach to security, implementing multiple security measures to protect systems in case one layer fails.
- **Weakest Link**: The security of a system is only as strong as its weakest component
- **Single Point of Failure**: A component in a system that, if it fails, would cause the entire system to fail, creating a critical vulnerability.
- **Anti-pattern (Defender Mindset)**: An overly defensive approach that focuses solely on preventing attacks rather than also considering detection and response strategies.

## Analysing Risk (NIST - National Institute of Standards and Technology)

- Low likelihood, low impact - we can mostly ignore these risks
- Low likelihood, high impact - very difficult to predict and assess
- High likelihood, low impact - easier to make predictions about due to history
- High likelihood, high impact - very dangerous

## Type I and Type II Errors
### Type I error (false positive)
This error occurs when a true null hypothesis is incorrectly rejected. 
- Test indicates patient has a disease when they actually do not

### Type II error (false negative)
This error happens when a false null hypothesis is not rejected.
- Test fails to detect the presence of the disease in an infected patient.
