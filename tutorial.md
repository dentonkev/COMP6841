## Tutorial 1

### Scenario 1
- Get under the table
- Bring table outside

### Scenario 2
### Plan A
- Since the earthquake and the headline has said only a "chance" for a tsunami then run towards the highest point 
- Run towards the library and take the stairs upwards towards level 8

**Strengths**
- higher vantage point, to avoid getting swept up by the tsunami. 
- easier to get rescued from the roof of the library (via helicopter)
- higher vision of what is happening around you and where to go next
- run to iga and take so canned food (lasts a long time)

**Shortcoming**
- not be enough time to get there before the tsunami arrives (news said only a chance so tsunami needs time to form and start approaching the coast)
- structural integrity of building after the earthquake is unknown. 
- tsunami might crash into the building causing it to collapse

### Plan B
- Find out if the tsunami is real
- Go to IGA and get survival supplies in case there actually is a tsunami and you will not have any contact for days.
- Keep phone on for distress messages.
